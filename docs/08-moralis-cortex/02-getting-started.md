# Getting Started with Moralis Cortex

Get up and running with AI-powered Web3 intelligence in minutes. This guide will help you make your first blockchain query using natural language.

## What is Moralis Cortex?

Moralis Cortex connects AI models to blockchain data through the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. Ask questions like "What tokens does vitalik.eth hold?" and get intelligent responses powered by real-time Web3 data.
