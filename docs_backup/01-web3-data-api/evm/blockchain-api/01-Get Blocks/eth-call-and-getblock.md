In the rapidly evolving realm of Web3, blockchain data retrieval is the lifeblood of security, transparency, and control. Traditional approaches like Ethereum's [`eth_call`](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v3.0.0-rc.5/web3-eth.html?highlight=eth.call#call) are giving way to innovative solutions like [Moralis](https://moralis.io/).

Decentralized applications (dapps) span a wide spectrum of use cases, from decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to DeFi platforms, gaming, NFT marketplaces, and beyond. Regardless of the specific application, efficient data retrieval is a common requirement for tasks like querying on-chain information, checking token balances, and interacting with smart contracts. Not only will this article demonstrate how blockchain data retrieval works using `eth_call`, but also how Moralis revolutionizes Ethereum data retrieval and why it's a compelling choice for developers working on a diverse range of dapp-related projects.

In addition, this article showcases how Moralis simplifies and streamlines ETH data retrieval and blockchain interactions, making it a valuable tool for developers across the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Understanding eth_call and eth_getBalance

### Exploring eth_call

While exploring contract interactions and blockchain data retrieval, it is important for dapp developers to use the `eth_call` method to simulate and execute message calls directly in the nodeâ€™s virtual machine (VM), without making any modifications and without creating a transaction to the blockchain. This read-only interaction capability is quintessential for querying smart contract functions, such as retrieving ERC-20 token balances with the `balanceOf` function.

Moralis offers a groundbreaking equivalent for `eth_call` with the [getBlock](/web3-data-api/evm/reference/get-block) RPC method, showcasing its innovative approach to data retrieval and blockchain interactions. This endpoint serves as a modern alternative, allowing developers to access extensive information about transactions, contract interactions, and more, all in a user-friendly manner.

### Exploring eth_getBalance

Developers use `eth_getBalance` to get the ETH (ether) balance of a given address or in other words to return an account's balance of a given address. This method is a fundamental aspect for managing transactions and displaying real-time user balance information.

Moralis presents the [getNativeBalance](/web3-data-api/evm/reference/get-native-balance) RPC method as the nearest equivalent to `eth_getBalance`. You can use it to obtain the native balance of an address which can be an important part in transaction management.

## Traditional vs. Modern: eth_call RPC Method Review and Comparison

Historically, developers have used Ethereum's `eth_call` method to interact with contracts without modifying the blockchain state. Here's an example:

```javascript
const Web3 = require("web3");
const web3 = new Web3("YOUR_INFURA_ENDPOINT");

const contractAddress = "YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS";
const data = "YOUR_DATA";

web3.eth
  .call({
    to: contractAddress,
    data: data,
  })
  .then(console.log);
```

In comparison, Moralis introduces a revolutionary approach that streamlines data retrieval and blockchain interactions using the [getBlock](/web3-data-api/evm/reference/get-block) endpoint. In the following example, you can see how Moralis' `getBlock` endpoint compares to `eth_call`:

```javascript
const Moralis = require("moralis").default;
const { EvmChain } = require("@moralisweb3/common-evm-utils");

async function runApp() {
  await Moralis.start({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });

  const blockNumberOrHash = "15863321";
  const chain = EvmChain.ETHEREUM;

  const response = await Moralis.EvmApi.block.getBlock({
    blockNumberOrHash,
    chain,
  });
  console.log(response.toJSON());
}

runApp();
```

## Why Developers Should Choose Moralis

Seamless user experiences are the essence of decentralized applications (dapps), and the 'eth_call' function has been instrumental in laying the foundation. However, the current landscape demands tools that combine speed with efficiency. Moralis stands as a pioneer in this regard, ushering in the next era of Ethereum development with advanced features using single lines of code, faster data retrieval, and enhanced security protocols.

**Key Use Cases:**

- **Retrieve Token Balance:** Obtain token balances at specific points in the past or present.
- **Query Contract State:** Access internal contract state data without altering it.
- **Validate Inputs:** Execute validations embedded within smart contracts.
- **Price Oracles:** Fetch real-world asset prices for use in decentralized applications.
- **Gas Estimation:** Estimate the gas cost of transactions before execution.

## ETH Blockchain Data Retrieval Using the eth_call RPC Method: Conclusion

The world of decentralized applications is rapidly evolving, and so is blockchain development. While the `eth_call` RPC method is quite powerful, new solutions that streamline Web3 development and outperform legacy methods like `eth_call` are emerging. One of these solutions is Moralis' getBlock endpoint, making ETH blockchain data retrieval a breeze!

In sum, this article compares Moralis to a more traditional solution and invites you to explore the world of Moralis and become a leader in the unfolding decentralized future. Armed with knowledge and supported by a community of like-minded developers, you can shape the future of the decentralized ecosystem with Moralis.
