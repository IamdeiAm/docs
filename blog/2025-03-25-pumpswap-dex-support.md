- **Access Swap Data by Token Address:** Fetch all swap-related transactions for a specific token address, enabling detailed analysis of token activity on PumpSwap. [Method Documentation](https://docs.moralis.com/web3-data-api/solana/reference/get-swaps-by-token-address)

- **Access Swap Data by Wallet Address:** Obtain all swap-related transactions associated with a specific wallet address, allowing for comprehensive tracking of user activity on PumpSwap. [Method Documentation](https://docs.moralis.com/web3-data-api/solana/reference/get-swaps-by-wallet-address)
